## Exercise: Explore, Clean, and Wrangle Data

Loading the libraries needed for the exercise:
```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```

Read in the data for the exercise and make a quick first exploration:
```{r}
lobster_abundance <- read_csv("data/Lobster_Abundance_All_Years_20220829.csv")
summary(lobster_abundance)
str(lobster_abundance)
```

Make a few changes to the dataframe
```{r}
lobster_abundance <- lobster_abundance %>%   # let's make sure NAs are properly recognized
    mutate(SIZE_MM = na_if(SIZE_MM, -99999))

not_napl <- lobster_abundance %>%    # let's create a dataframe that excludes obs from site=NAPL
    filter(SITE != "NAPL")

aque_70mm <- lobster_abundance %>%     # let's create a dataframe that include only site=AQUE & carapace length > 70 mm
    filter(SITE == "AQUE" & SIZE_MM >= 70)
```
